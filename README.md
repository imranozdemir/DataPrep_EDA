# Data Preprocessing and EDA

**Data Preprocessing** is a step in the data analysis process that takes raw data and transforms it into a format to be analyzed by machine learning algorithms.

-**Outliers**

 * Note that tree-based models robust to outliers

-**Missing Values**

 * Analysis of missing data requires an understanding of whether or not the value is missing at **random**, or whether there is some systemic reason for some of the data to be missing.

-**Encoding**
 
 * Label Encoding
 * One-Hot Encoding
 * Rare Encoding
   
    ** Rare labels are those that appear only in a tiny proportion of the observations in a dataset. Rare labels may cause some issues, especially with overfitting and generalization.
The solution to that problem is to group those rare labels into a new category like other or rareâ€”this way, the possible issues can be prevented.
